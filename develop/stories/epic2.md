# Epic 2: Register sessions of work

## Work sessions
#### Basic operations
* Register start of a work session (creation)
  - A work session belongs to a subject XOR a task
* Register stop of a work session
* Register a pause of a work session
* Delete a session

#### More
* Modify when did I stopped a work session (edit timestamp)
  - can only reduce time worked, not increment
* Add information to a session
  - At any time, when starting, stopping, when running, when stopped

#### Currently running sessions
* Check the state of the running sessions
* Limit the amount of running sessions to a maximum of X
* Visualize on the screen (at all times) the status of the sessions (running, paused, stopped)
