***

## Theme 1: Work Subjects
Use for a subject you may be working for a long period

1. CRUD work subjects
  - name, info
2. Nest subjects ???
  - REVIEW: This can be replaced with categories?
3. Archive/Unarchive work subjects
  - don't delete, just hide

## Theme 2: Work Task
Use for a specific task (usually time bounded)

1. CRUD task
  - name, info
  - deadline
2. Nest tasks
  - subdivide tasks in steps (that are also tasks) (nesting + order them)
3. Mark/unmark a task as part of a subject
4. Finish task
  - mark/unmark as finished
  - when its finished can't use it anymore

## Theme 3: Subject Categories
1. CRUD categories
2. Mark/unmark a subject with a category

## Theme 4: Tags
1. CRUD tags
2. Nest tags
  - then, tagging something with a child tag automatically tags it with the parent tag
3. Tag/untag subjects/tasks/sessions/categories
4. Apply restrictions on tags
  - can't be applied to subjects, tasks or sessions
  - only can be applied to something
